3dfx was a pioneering consumer computer graphics company best known for its Voodoo Graphics accelerators for PCs. Their graphics products also found their way into popular arcade games such as San Francisco Rush and NFL Blitz. 3dfx's cards and their Glide API were arguably the most popular and important products of their era. Despite their early dominance in the computer graphics industry, 3dfx went from industry leader to bankruptcy in just a few years' span. In this oral history, the four original co-founders discuss the history of 3dfx, lessons learned, and anecdotes from their careers in technology.

Amanda Gorman, 22, became the youngest inaugural poet in U.S. history after reciting her poem “The Hill We Climb.”

“But while democracy can be periodically delayed, it can never be permanently defeated,” Gorman read. “In this truth, in this faith, we trust.”

Gorman is the current United States Poet Laureate. At age 16, Gorman became the Youth Poet Laureate of Los Angeles and later became the first National Youth Poet Laureate in 2017 as a sociology student at Harvard.

First Lady Jill Biden invited Gorman to participate in the inauguration in late December after hearing the poet at the Library of Congress.

Gorman immediately made waves following her reading at the inaugural ceremony, becoming the top trending Google search topic in the U.S.

Her words rang across the country: “A skinny Black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president, only to find herself reciting for one.”

      <title>Hamming, &#34;You and Your Research&#34; (June 6, 1995)</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=a1zDuOPkMSw</link>
      <description>Intro: I have given a talk with this title many times, and it turns out from discussions after the talk I could have just as well have called it &#34;You and Your Engineering Career,&#34; or even &#34;You and Your Career.&#34; But I left the word &#34;Research&#34; in the title because that is what I have most studied. From the previous chapters you have an adequate background for how I made the study, and I need not mention again the names of the famous people I have studied closely. The earlier chapters are, in sense, just a great expansion, with much more detail, of the original talk. This chapter is, in a sense, a summary of the previous chapters.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;The Art of Doing Science and Engineering: Learning to Learn&#34; was the capstone course by Dr. Richard W. Hamming (1915-1998) for graduate students at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) in Monterey California. &#xA;&#xA;This course is intended to instill a &#34;style of thinking&#34; that will enhance one&#39;s ability to function as a problem solver of complex technical issues. With respect, students sometimes called the course &#34;Hamming on Hamming&#34; because he relates many research collaborations, discoveries, inventions and achievements of his own. This collection of stories and carefully distilled insights relates how those discoveries came about. Most importantly, these presentations provide objective analysis about the thought processes and reasoning that took place as Dr. Hamming, his associates and other major thinkers, in computer science and electronics, progressed through the grand challenges of science and engineering in the twentieth century.</description>

      <itunes:summary><![CDATA[Intro: I have given a talk with this title many times, and it turns out from discussions after the talk I could have just as well have called it "You and Your Engineering Career," or even "You and Your Career." But I left the word "Research" in the title because that is what I have most studied. From the previous chapters you have an adequate background for how I made the study, and I need not mention again the names of the famous people I have studied closely. The earlier chapters are, in sense, just a great expansion, with much more detail, of the original talk. This chapter is, in a sense, a summary of the previous chapters.



The Art of Doing Science and Engineering: Learning to Learn" was the capstone course by Dr. Richard W. Hamming (1915-1998) for graduate students at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) in Monterey California. 

This course is intended to instill a "style of thinking" that will enhance one's ability to function as a problem solver of complex technical issues. With respect, students sometimes called the course "Hamming on Hamming" because he relates many research collaborations, discoveries, inventions and achievements of his own. This collection of stories and carefully distilled insights relates how those discoveries came about. Most importantly, these presentations provide objective analysis about the thought processes and reasoning that took place as Dr. Hamming, his associates and other major thinkers, in computer science and electronics, progressed through the grand challenges of science and engineering in the twentieth century.]]></itunes:summary>

      <title>What is web assembly?</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=d_yxhNGsJU8</link>
      <description>Today web programming is limited to JavaScript. Tomorrow we’ll probably see something different. Web assembly aims to break JavaScript’s monopoly on the browser using an old-fashioned approach. Rather than using a single interpreted language (JavaScript), web programs could be written in any language and then compiled down into (web) assembly code that would run in the browser. In the future, it’s unlikely that JavaScript will maintain its hold on frontend web development. But it had a great run.&#xA;&#xA;Credits: Talking: Geoffrey Challen (Assistant Professor, Computer Science and Engineering, University at Buffalo). Producing: Greg Bunyea (Undergraduate, Computer Science and Engineering, University at Buffalo).&#xA;&#xA;Part of the https://www.internet-class.org online internet course.

      <description>Why discuss the internet?&#xA;The internet is the transformative technology of our age. It defines the era that we live in. And if you are a computer scientist, it represents the crowning achievement of your field and the platform that will deliver most of your new great ideas. Discussing the internet allows us to survey some of the best contributions of computer science, learn powerful design principles, and understand the world around us. Discussing the internet also allows us to consider how it is changing us, and dream about how we can use it to change our world.&#xA;&#xA;Credits: Talking: Geoffrey Challen (Assistant Professor, Computer Science and Engineering, University at Buffalo).
