      <title>Hamming, &#34;You and Your Research&#34; (June 6, 1995)</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=a1zDuOPkMSw</link>
      <description>Intro: I have given a talk with this title many times, and it turns out from discussions after the talk I could have just as well have called it &#34;You and Your Engineering Career,&#34; or even &#34;You and Your Career.&#34; But I left the word &#34;Research&#34; in the title because that is what I have most studied. From the previous chapters you have an adequate background for how I made the study, and I need not mention again the names of the famous people I have studied closely. The earlier chapters are, in sense, just a great expansion, with much more detail, of the original talk. This chapter is, in a sense, a summary of the previous chapters.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;The Art of Doing Science and Engineering: Learning to Learn&#34; was the capstone course by Dr. Richard W. Hamming (1915-1998) for graduate students at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) in Monterey California. &#xA;&#xA;This course is intended to instill a &#34;style of thinking&#34; that will enhance one&#39;s ability to function as a problem solver of complex technical issues. With respect, students sometimes called the course &#34;Hamming on Hamming&#34; because he relates many research collaborations, discoveries, inventions and achievements of his own. This collection of stories and carefully distilled insights relates how those discoveries came about. Most importantly, these presentations provide objective analysis about the thought processes and reasoning that took place as Dr. Hamming, his associates and other major thinkers, in computer science and electronics, progressed through the grand challenges of science and engineering in the twentieth century.</description>

The Art of Doing Science and Engineering: Learning to Learn" was the capstone course by Dr. Richard W. Hamming (1915-1998) for graduate students at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) in Monterey California. 

This course is intended to instill a "style of thinking" that will enhance one's ability to function as a problem solver of complex technical issues. With respect, students sometimes called the course "Hamming on Hamming" because he relates many research collaborations, discoveries, inventions and achievements of his own. This collection of stories and carefully distilled insights relates how those discoveries came about.

      <title>What is web assembly?</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=d_yxhNGsJU8</link>
      <description>Today web programming is limited to JavaScript. Tomorrow we’ll probably see something different. Web assembly aims to break JavaScript’s monopoly on the browser using an old-fashioned approach. Rather than using a single interpreted language (JavaScript), web programs could be written in any language and then compiled down into (web) assembly code that would run in the browser. In the future, it’s unlikely that JavaScript will maintain its hold on frontend web development. But it had a great run.&#xA;&#xA;Credits: Talking: Geoffrey Challen (Assistant Professor, Computer Science and Engineering, University at Buffalo). Producing: Greg Bunyea (Undergraduate, Computer Science and Engineering, University at Buffalo).&#xA;&#xA;Part of the https://www.internet-class.org online internet course.

      <description>Why discuss the internet?&#xA;The internet is the transformative technology of our age. It defines the era that we live in. And if you are a computer scientist, it represents the crowning achievement of your field and the platform that will deliver most of your new great ideas. Discussing the internet allows us to survey some of the best contributions of computer science, learn powerful design principles, and understand the world around us. Discussing the internet also allows us to consider how it is changing us, and dream about how we can use it to change our world.&#xA;&#xA;Credits: Talking: Geoffrey Challen (Assistant Professor, Computer Science and Engineering, University at Buffalo).
